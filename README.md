# API Post Gallery

API Post Gallery is a WordPress plugin that fetches posts from an external API and displays them in a sleek, responsive gallery format on your WordPress site.

## Features

- **Dynamic Post Fetching**: Automatically retrieves posts from a specified external API.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures your post gallery looks great on all devices.
- **Customizable Slider**: In upcoming versions, more customizability will be added to provide users with an even richer set of options for personalizing their post galleries.
- **Caching**: Utilizes WordPress transients for efficient API data fetching and reduced load times.
- **Easy to Use**: Shortcode integration for simple setup and placement within your WordPress site.

## Compatibility

This plugin's compatibility has been tested with the Elementor page builder. While it should work well with Elementor, there may be front-end issues when using other page builders. â€‹It planned to address and fix these incompatibilities in future versions to ensure broad compatibility across various page builders.
